# R's popularity

There are multiple ways to measure a language popularity, and one of them is the
number of R questions in Stack Overflow, which has been increasing over the
years as shown in the following plot [@stackoverflow2024].

```{r stackoverflow, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3, fig.cap = "R Questions in Stack Overflow increase from 2,260 in 2010 to 28,385 in 2023 with a peak of 59,895 in 2020.", fig.pos = "H"}
library(readr)
library(janitor)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)

stackoverflow <- read_csv("data/stackoverflow.csv") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  rename(same_yr_pct = r_percentage) %>%
  mutate(
    prev_yr_pct = r_questions / lag(r_questions) * 100,
  ) %>%
  filter(year > 2009, year < 2024)

clrs <- c("#165976", "#d04e66")

g1 <- ggplot(stackoverflow, aes(x = year, y = r_questions)) +
  geom_line(color = clrs[1]) +
  geom_point(color = clrs[1]) +
  labs(
    title = "R Questions in Stack Overflow",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Number of Questions (N)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)

g2 <- ggplot(stackoverflow, aes(x = year, y = prev_yr_pct)) +
  geom_line(color = clrs[2]) +
  geom_point(color = clrs[2]) +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Year-over-Year Growth (%)",
    caption = "Data Source: Adapted from Stack Overflow"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)

g1 + g2

ggsave("stackoverflow.svg", width = 5, height = 3, dpi = 300)
```
